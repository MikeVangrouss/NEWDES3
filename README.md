# NEWDES3
NEWDES3 Block cipher encryption source code in C. 9344-bit keys. 128-bit block cipher (like AES) 64 rounds.

9344-bit total key.

Based on NEWDES by Robert Scott.

Uses MD2II hash function to create the 9344-bit keys.

Code free for all, even for commercial software No restriction to use. Public Domain

Compile with gcc: gcc newdes3.c -o newdes3

NEWDES3 was released in 2016 and is based on NEWDES. It has exactly the same design as NEWDES but uses 16-bit integers instead of 8-bit integers. 

NEWDES used a fixed 256 * 8-bit S table, so always the same. NEWDES3 uses a 65536 * 16-bit S table, which is key-dependent and is generated by a pseudo-random generator based on RC4 and Splitmix64.

The subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function, representing 9344 bits. Thus, attacks against NEWDES do not work with NEWDES3.
